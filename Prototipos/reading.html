      <h2>Reading comprehension: A double life</h2>
      <p>
        Len Parkins is 24 and for the past three years he has worked in a bank in a small town in the
north of England. There is nothing unusual or surprising about Len’s appearance. He is of
average height, neither fat nor thin, and his face is pleasant but quite ordinary. For work, at least,
Len dresses conservatively. Today, for instance, he is wearing a dark suit, white shirt, blue tie
and black shoes. Len, however, is living proof that appearances can be deceptive.
‘I look like this because it's what people expect of me in this job’, says Len. This is a small place
and people are friendly but they have certain expectations. They don’t want to come into their
local bank to be served by someone with green hair and a ring through his nose. | actually like
body art and modern clothes but they aren't acceptable at the bank. Of course | can wear what |
want in the evenings and at weekends. | can also have piercings and tattoos but they can't be too
obvious.’

In fact, Len has tattoos all over his upper body and arms. Some of them are very intricate
and colourful. They are not visible at work because he wears long-sleeved shirts. He also has a
piercing through his navel and he is thinking of having his nipples pierced too. Len says this is his
way of rebelling a little against the world of work and routine. He seems to be
conforming, but underneath his clothes he shows his creative side by adorning his body in
different ways. ‘People think that if you work in a bank, you are a boring person with no interest in
fashion,” says Len. ‘At weekends | don't dress like this at all. | love jeans, T- shirts and bright
colours. | would like to experiment more with different hair styles too, but my job makes it difficult.’
Len’s work ‘uniform’ of suit, shirt and tie might lead you to believe that his taste in music is on the
conservative side too. In fact, he has an extremely varied and up-to-date collection of CDs. R 'n"
B and hip hop are favourites at the moment. He is also into world music and can talk for hours
about the delights of flamenco and fado.

‘I enjoy surprising people,” he says. ‘When | meet someone outside work who's seen me in
the bank, they always look a bit surprised because | look so different. It just shows that
you can't judge a book by its cover!’
